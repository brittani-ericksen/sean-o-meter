## Sean-o-Meter
A solo project built with React.

## Decription
A simple ranking system for how annoying Sean is being, with a button that randomly generates what a person would rather do than listen to him.

## Motivation
This project was meant to be for fun and is not meant to insult anyone. I'm definitely a "if I make fun of you, it's because we're friends" kind of person and that's what this is. Please enjoy! 

## Challenges and Solutions
After spending a rough day going over Redux, I swore I would never touch it again. When looking for a way to store state in this project, I ended up going back to Redux and was able to implement it with some work.
